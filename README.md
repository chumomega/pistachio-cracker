# Nutty Efficiency

Welcome to the Nutty Efficiency! This is a fun and interactive web app that demonstrates different strategies for cracking and eating pistachios. It showcases two scenarios using visual simulations to compare performance.

## Structure of the App

### Files and Directories

- **`src/`**: Contains the main source code for the app.
  - **`App.js`**: The main React component that renders the application, manages state, and handles simulation logic for both scenarios.
  - **`App.css`**: Styling for the app, including animations and visual design.
- **`public/`**: Contains static files such as the favicon, manifest, and index.html.
  - **`favicon.ico`**: The app's favicon for legacy browsers.
  - **`manifest.json`**: Metadata for progressive web app functionality.
- **`build/`**: Generated during the production build. Contains minified static files for deployment.

### Scenarios in the App

- **Scenario 1**: Uses a single data structure to store pistachio nuts and simulates finding, cracking, and eating them.
- **Scenario 2**: Uses two data structures, separating nuts from shells, to demonstrate a potentially more efficient cracking process.
